            <p>whahaahahhaah</p>
            <p> i wanna explain pero i cant talaga sa chat ewan ko ba, so i did this.. i work well with code e</p>
            <p>um mahiyain lng talaga kasi ako, specially sa'yo, who knows what i might impulsively say that may unintentionally offend you, 
                if i get too comfortable. like u, i care bout your comfort more than anything else... 
                kaya in denial noon kasi nagugulat ako kapag u openly admit na u know that i like you in a joking manner,
                 meant; you already know na pero hindi mo lang pinapansin or sineseryoso, why i’m defensive kasi— medyo flustered yknow nahihiya, 
                 ayoko lang din maging straightforward kasi i planned on getting to know u more better… i often deny kasi if u took it seriously, 
                 what if umiwas ka or ano? i genuinely like u as a person. but i didn’t expect that you would find out “that” way.:((
                 plus pinopormahan nga kita, hindi mo lng pinapansin, 
                 so i thought maybe y’know- that you aint interested.</p>
     
            <p>then i received na may kausap ka na daw and that i’m getting in u guys, 
                (basta ung sa anon) so i figured i’d distance myself, 
                jealousy isn’t really a kind nature a person could have pero it’s there, even if walang karapatan,
                 syempre u like that person, valid lang magselos diba, 
                 kaya if we intend to stay close despite- then mas lalo lang ako ma f-fall saiyo one sidedly. 
                 hindi naman ako mag rereact doon and would silently distance myself if they didn’t asked me to “kms”, 
                 i just let out my frustration because i’m so sensitive sa word na ganiyan- tapos na nag react si freia, 
                she’s like my shield, willing to take a bullet for me, and have been pestering me to talk to u nga. KASO NAHIHIYA AKO. .</p>
